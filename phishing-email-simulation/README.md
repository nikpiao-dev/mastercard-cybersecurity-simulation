# Phishing Email Simulation

## Task Overview

As part of the Mastercard Cybersecurity Virtual Experience on Forage, I completed a simulation that required designing a realistic phishing email. The goal was to craft a message that could trick an employee into clicking a malicious link, helping simulate how cyber threats are used in real-world attacks.

## Files Included

- **Phishing_Email.pdf**  
  The original formatted version of the phishing email as submitted for the simulation.

- **phishing_email_example.txt**  
  A plain text version of the email for easy review and accessibility.

- **phishing_email_task.md**  
  A detailed explanation of the task, the objectives, my design approach, and key elements used to make the phishing email convincing.

## Objective

To demonstrate an understanding of phishing tactics and how cybercriminals manipulate language, branding, and urgency to exploit human behavior.
