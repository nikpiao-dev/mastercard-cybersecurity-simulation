### 1. Phishing Email Simulation

- **Objective**: Craft a phishing email simulation to be used to raise awareness of one of the most common cybersecurity threats.

- **Task**: You need to recreate and improve the obvious fake email to make it more believable. Remember, the end goal is to encourage the user to click on the link.

To create a ‘good’ phishing email, you should:

- Add some context at the beginning — make it relevant to a Mastercard employee  
- Mask the hyperlink within text  
- Use correct spelling and grammar  
- Add points of legitimacy  

Once you've submitted your email, we'll show you an example of a good phishing email.
